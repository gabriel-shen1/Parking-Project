These are java files so copying them to a ide should make them runnable.
hash.java - Creates the hashed password
security.java - A class just to run and test hash.java
hashTest.java - A unit test for hash.java.
If the unit test does not run the junit true/false then create a junit test and copy code over
  In the package with hash.java and security.java left click and click new, Junit Test Class, name the class hashTest and copy code over.
